The integrated\u00a0option is designed principally for students from across the university who are interested in pursuing a teaching credential in a single subject content area.

The student will register for CHEM 491 or CHEM 499 for a minimum of three credits over two consecutive semesters (or one semester with approval of the program director) in their senior year and complete a faculty-mentored student research project. The student will write a formal research paper modeled after the formal lab report and will present this research in poster format at the University Student Scholar Symposium. The report is due at the end of the final semester of the senior year. When appropriate, a faculty member may substitute a team research project for an individual research project. When a team project is substituted, all members of the team must write a research paper modeled after the formal lab report. The team will present this project in poster format at the University Student Scholar Symposium. Students will give an oral presentation of their research to the chemistry faculty at the end of fall or spring semester in their senior year.",

Students become productive global citizens as they learn how to engage in rigorous application of communication theory and research while increasing linguistic and practical skills and broadening their awareness of culture to prepare for the global workplace. Graduates are in high demand as they combine core communication skills with high-level proficiency in a world language. They will be able to pursue careers in diplomacy, government, health care professions, journalism, NGOs, philanthropic organizations with international reach and more. The nine credit hour Capstone sequence, which includes a service learning course/internship, intensive research in their chosen language, and a senior seminar in the global workplace, will provide students with hands on experience, which future employers will value."

Graduates are in high demand as they combine core communication skills with high-level proficiency in a world language.

Graduates are in high demand as they combine core communication skills with high-level proficiency in a world language. They will be able to pursue careers in diplomacy, government, health care professions, journalism, NGOs, philanthropic organizations with international reach and more. The nine credit hour Capstone sequence, which includes a service learning course/internship, intensive research in their chosen language, and a senior seminar in the global workplace, will provide students with hands on experience, which future employers will value."

Graduates are in high demand as they combine core communication skills with high-level proficiency in a world language. They will be able to pursue careers in diplomacy, government, health care professions, journalism, NGOs, philanthropic organizations with international reach and more. The nine credit hour Capstone sequence, which includes a service learning course/internship, intensive research in their chosen language, and a senior seminar in the global workplace, will provide students with hands on experience, which future employers will value."

Students become productive global citizens as they learn how to engage in rigorous application of communication theory and research while increasing linguistic and practical skills and broadening their awareness of culture to prepare for the global workplace. Graduates are in high demand as they combine core communication skills with high-level proficiency in a world language. They will be able to pursue careers in diplomacy, government, health care professions, journalism, NGOs, philanthropic organizations with international reach and more. The nine credit hour Capstone sequence, which includes a service learning course/internship, intensive research in their chosen language, and a senior seminar in the global workplace, will provide students with hands on experience, which future employers will value."

Students apply to the M.A. during their junior year or first semester of their senior year. In order to enroll in a graduate course, a student must have a GPA of 3.0 and will have completed 90 credits at the time the course begins. Students will receive conditional admission to the program, pending completion of their B.A. degree as stipulated in the graduate catalog (see explanation of conditional admission in the graduate catalog). If accepted to the M.A. program, students can take up to 12 approved graduate credits during their senior year. These credits can be used to satisfy the undergraduate graduation requirements and count toward the M.A. in English. Any 500-level course that is approved for MA credit is eligible to count toward the accelerated\u00a0program. Students who wish to apply for the Graduate Teaching Assistant Program must take ENG 580 during the spring semester of their senior year.\u00a0(See the Graduate catalog for more details.)"

Graduates are in high demand as they combine core communication skills with high-level proficiency in a world language. They will be able to pursue careers in diplomacy, government, health care professions, journalism, NGOs, philanthropic organizations with international reach and more. The nine credit hour Capstone sequence, which includes a service learning course/internship, intensive research in their chosen language, and a senior seminar in the global workplace, will provide students with hands on experience, which future employers will value."

When a team project is substituted, all members of the team must write a research paper modeled after the formal lab report. The team will present this project in poster format at the University Student Scholar Symposium. Students will give an oral presentation of their research to the biochemistry and molecular biology faculty at the end of fall or spring semester in their senior year.",

Students become productive global citizens as they learn how to engage in rigorous application of communication theory and research while increasing linguistic and practical skills and broadening their awareness of culture to prepare for the global workplace. Graduates are in high demand as they combine core communication skills with high-level proficiency in a world language. They will be able to pursue careers in diplomacy, government, health care professions, journalism, NGOs, philanthropic organizations with international reach and more. The nine credit hour Capstone sequence, which includes a service learning course/internship, intensive research in their chosen language, and a senior seminar in the global workplace, will provide students with hands on experience, which future employers will value."

Students must have a minimum of 90 credits have been completed or will be completed prior to start of the course in order to enroll in a graduate course and a cumulative GPA of at least 3.000. Students will receive conditional admission to the program, pending completion of their B.A. degree as stipulated in the graduate catalog (see explanation of conditional admission in the graduate catalog). If accepted to the M.A. program, students can take up to 12 approved graduate credits during their senior year. These credits can be used to satisfy the undergraduate graduation requirements and count toward the M.A. in English. Any 500-level course that is approved for MA credit is eligible to count toward the accelerated\u00a0program. Students who wish to apply for the Graduate Teaching Assistant Program must take ENG 580 during the spring semester of their senior year."
